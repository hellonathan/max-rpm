Summary: A CD player app that rocks!
Name: cdplayer
Version: 1.0
Release: 1
License: GPL
Group: Applications/Sound
Source: ftp://ftp.gnomovision.com/pub/cdplayer/cdplayer-1.0.tgz
URL: http://www.gnomovision.com/cdplayer/cdplayer.html
Distribution: WSS Linux
Vendor: White Socks Software, Inc.
Packager: Santa Claus &#60;sclaus@northpole.com&#62;

%description
It slices!  It dices!  It's a CD player app that
can't be beat.  By using the resonant frequency
of the CD itself, it is able to simulate 20X
oversampling.  This leads to sound quality that
cannot be equaled with more mundane software...</SAMP

          with a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>tag</I
> followed by a colon, and then some
          information.  For example, the line starting with
          "<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Summary:</B

          packaged software that can be displayed by RPM.  The order of the
          lines is not important, as long as they appear in the preamble.

          Always remember &#8212; if it isn't in the file list, it won't be put
          in the package!

          This is necessary as the files will actually be installed in those
          directories by the application's makefile.  Since RPM needs to be able
          to find the files prior to packaging them, complete paths are
          required.

><P
>            Since RPM automates so many aspects of software installation, it's
            easy to fall into the trap of assuming that RPM does
            <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>everything</I
> for you.  Not so!  One task that is
            still a manual process is creating the file list.  While it may seem
            at first glance, that it could be automated somehow, it's actually a
            more difficult problem than it seems.
          </P
><P
>            Since the majority of an application's files are installed by its
            makefile, RPM has no control over that part of the build process,
            and therefore, cannot automatically determine which files should be
            part of the package.  Some people have attempted to use a modified
            version of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>install</B
> that logs the name of every
            file it installs.  But not every makefile uses
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>install</B
>, or if it does, uses it sporadically.
          </P
><P
>            Another approach tried was to obtain a list of every file on the
            build system, immediately before and after a build, and use the
            differences as the file list.  While this approach will certainly
            find every file that the application installed, it can also pick up
            extraneous files, such as system logs, files in
            <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/tmp</TT
>, and the like.  The only way to begin to
            make this approach workable would be to do nothing else on the build
            system, which is highly inconvenient.  This approach also precludes
            building more than one package on the system at any given time.
          </P
><P
>            At present, the best way to create the file list is to read the
            makefile to see what files it installs, verify this against the
            files installed on the build system, and create the list.
