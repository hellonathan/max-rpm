        provide some control over whether a package will be built on a given
        architecture and/or operating system, that control is still rather
        coarse.

>        For example, what should be done if a package will build under multiple
        architectures, but requires slightly different <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%build</B
>
        scripts?  Or what if a package requires a certain set of files under one
        operating system, and an entirely different set under another operating
        system?  The architecture and operating system-specific tags we've
        discussed earlier in the chapter do nothing to help in such situations.
        What can be done?
      </P
><P
>        One approach would be to simply create different spec files for each
        architecture or operating system.  While it would certainly work, this
        approach has some problems:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              More work.  The existence of multiple spec files for a given
              package means that the effort required to make any changes to the
              package is multiplied by however many different spec files there
              are.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              More chance for mistakes.  If any work needs to be done to the
              spec files, the fact they are separate means it is that much
              easier to forget to make the necessary changes to each one.  There
              is also the chance of introducing mistakes each time changes are
              made.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>        The other approach is to somehow permit the conditional inclusion of
        architecture- or operating system-specific sections of the spec file.
        Fortunately, the RPM designers chose this approach, and it makes
        multi-platform package building easier and less prone to mistakes.

          of the spec file that is architecture-specific.  It is followed by one
          or more architecture specifiers, each separated by commas or
          whitespace.  Here is an example:

          line were placed in a spec file, this is what would happen if a build
          was attempted:

          <B

          the file contents after the <B
