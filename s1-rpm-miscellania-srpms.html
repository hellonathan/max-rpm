        display information about a package file, even if the filename has been

        the "<TT

>          This package file contains not the executable, or "binary", files that
          a normal package contains, but rather the "source" files required to

          write the instructions, often called "code", in one or more files.
          The source code is then compiled into a binary that can be executed by
          the computer.

          <TT

          But what is that "spec" file mentioned in the output?  It mentions
          something about "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/redhat/SPECS</TT
>", so let's
          see what we have in that directory:
