><P
>      Now that we've seen the design philosophy of RPM, let's look at the nuts
      and bolts of RPM's build process.  Building a package is similar to
      compiling code &#8212; there are inputs, an engine that does the dirty
      work, and outputs.
    </P
><DIV
CLASS="SECT1"

CLASS="SECT1"

NAME="S1-RPM-BASICS-INPUTS"
>The Inputs</A
></H1
><P
>        There are three different kinds of inputs that are used to drive RPM's
        build process.  Two of the three inputs are required, and the third,
        strictly speaking, is optional.  But unless you're packaging your own
        code, chances are you'll need it.
      </P
><DIV

CLASS="SECT2"

NAME="S2-RPM-BASICS-SOURCES"
>The Sources</A
></H2
><P
>          First and foremost, are the sources.  After all, without them, there
          wouldn't be much to build!  In the case of packaging someone else's
          software, the sources should be kept as the author distributed them,
          which usually means a compressed <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
> file.  RPM can
          handle other archive formats, but a bit more up-front effort is
          required.
        </P
><P
>          In any case, you should not modify the sources used in the package
          building process.  If you're a third-party package builder, that means
          the sources should be just the way you got them from the author's FTP
          site.  If it's your own software, the choice is up to you, but you
          should consider starting with your mainstream sources.

NAME="S2-RPM-BASICS-PATCHES"
>The Patches</A
></H2
><P
>          Why all the emphasis on unmodified sources?  Because RPM gives you the
          ability to automatically apply patches to them.  Usually, the nature
          of these patches falls into one of the following categories:

          <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>                The patch addresses an issue specific to the target system.
                This could include changing makefiles to install the application
                into the appropriate directories, or resolving cross-platform
                conflicts, such as replacing BSD system calls with their SYSV
                counterparts.
              </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>                The patch creates files that are normally created during a
                configuration step in the installation process.  Many times,
                it's necessary to either edit configuration files or scripts in
                order to set things up for compilation.  In other cases, a
                configuration utility needs to be run before the sources are
                compiled.  In either instance, the patches create the
                environment required for proper compilation.

><P
>            While it might sound a bit daunting to take into account the types of
            patches outlined above, it's really quite simple.  Here's how it's done:

            <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"

><P
>                  Unpack the sources.
                </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>                  Rename the top-level directory.  Make it end with ".orig", for
                  example.
                </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>                  Unpack the sources again, leaving the top-level directory name
                  unchanged.
                </P
></LI
></OL
>
          </P
><P
>            The source tree that you created the second time will be the one
            you'll use to get the software to build.
          </P
><P
>            If the software builds with no changes required, that's great
            &#8212; you won't need a patch.  But if you had to make any changes,
            you'll have to create a set of patches.  To do so, simply clean the
            source directory of any binaries.  Then, issue a recursive
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>diff</B
> command to compare the source tree you used
            for the build, against the original, unmodified source tree.  It's
            as easy as that!

NAME="S2-RPM-BASICS-SPEC-FILE"
>The Spec File</A
></H2
><P
>          The spec file is at the heart of RPM's packaging building process.
          Similar in concept to a makefile, it contains information required by
          RPM to build the package, as well as instructions telling RPM
          <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>how</I
> to build it.  The spec file also dictates
          exactly what files are a part of the package, and where they should be
          installed.
        </P
><P
>          As you might imagine, with this many responsibilities, the spec file
          format can be a bit complex.  However, it's broken into several
          sections, making it easier to handle.  All told, there are eight
          sections:

><P
>              The preamble contains information that will be displayed when
              users request information about the package.  This would include a
              description of the package's function, the version number of the
              software, and so on.  Also contained in the preamble are lines
              identifying sources, patches, and even an icon to be used if the
              package is manipulated by graphical interface.

NAME="S3-RPM-BASICS-SPEC-PREP"
>The Prep Section</A
></H3
><P
>              The prep section is where the actual work of building a package
              starts.  As the name implies, this section is where the necessary
              preparations are made prior to the actual building of the
              software.  In general, if anything needs to be done to the sources
              prior to building the software, it needs to happen in the prep
              section.  Usually, this boils down to unpacking the sources.
            </P
><P
>              The contents of this section are an ordinary shell script.
              However, RPM does provide two macros to make life easier.  One
              macro can unpack a compressed <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
> file and
              <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cd</B
> into the source directory.  The other macro
              easily applies patches to the unpacked sources.

              script.  As you might guess, this section is used to perform
              whatever commands are required to actually compile the sources.
              This section could consist of a single <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
>
              command, or be more complex if the build process requires it.
              Since most software is built today using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
>,
              there are no macros available in this section.

              perform the commands required to actually install the software.
              If the software's author added an install target in the makefile,
              this section might only consist of a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make
              install</B

              usual assortment of <B

              by RPM to build the package, or the actual commands to do the
              deed, this section is different.  It consists of scripts that will
              be run, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>on the user's system</I
>, when the
              package is actually installed or removed.  RPM can execute a
              script:

              <P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"

></LI
></UL
>
            </P
><P
>              One example of when this capability would be required is when a
              package contains shared libraries.  In this case,
              <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ldconfig</B
> would need to be run after the package
              is installed or erased.  As another example, if a package contains
              a shell, the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/shells</TT
> would need to
              be updated appropriately when the package was installed or erased.

              is executed when RPM verifies the package's proper installation.
              While RPM does most of the work verifying packages, this script
              can be used to verify aspects of the package that are beyond RPM's

              files are documentation, and which contain configuration
              information.  The file list is very important &#8212; if it is
