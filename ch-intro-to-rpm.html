>        To answer that question, let's go back to the basics for a moment.
        Computers process information.  In order for this to happen, there are
        some prerequisites:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              A computer (<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Obviously!</I
>).
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              Some information to process (Also obvious!).
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              A program to do the processing (Still pretty obvious!).
            </P
></LI
></UL
>

        Unless these three things come together very little is going to happen,
        information processing-wise.  But each of these items have their own
        requirements that need to be satisfied before things can get exciting.
      </P
><P
>        Take the computer, for example.  While it needs things like electricity
        and a cool, dry place to operate, it also needs access to the other two
        items &#8212; information and programs &#8212; in order to do its thing.
        The way to get information and programs into a computer is to place them
        in the computer's mass storage.  These days, mass storage invariably
        means a disk drive.  Putting information and programs on the disk drive
        means that they are stored as files.  So much for the computer's part in
        this.
      </P
><P
>        OK, let's look at the information.  Does information have any particular
        needs?  Well, it needs sufficient space on the disk drive, but more
        importantly, it needs to be in the proper format for the program that
        will be processing it.  That's it for information.
      </P
><P
>        Finally, we have the program.  What does it need?  Like the information,
        it needs sufficient disk space on the disk drive.  But there are many
        other things that it may need:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              It may need information to process, in the correct format, named
              properly, and in the appropriate area on a disk drive somewhere.

              
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              It may need one or more configuration files.  These are files that
              control the program's behavior and permit some level of
              customization.  Like the information, these files must be in the
              proper format, named properly, and in the appropriate area on a
              disk.  We'll be referring to them by their other name &#8212;
              <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"

> files &#8212; throughout the book.
            </P

STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              It may need work areas on a disk, named properly, and located in
              the appropriate area.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              It may even need other programs, each with their
              <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>own</I
> requirements.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              Although not strictly required by the program itself, the program
              may come with one or more files containing documentation.  These
              files can be very handy for the humans trying to get the program
              to do their bidding!
            </P
></LI
></UL

      </P
><P
>        As you can imagine, this can get pretty complicated.  It's not so bad
        once everything is set up properly, but how do things get set up
        properly in the first place?  There are two possibilities:

       <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>              After reading the documentation that comes with the program you'd
              like to use, you copy the various programs, configuration files,
              and information onto your computer, making sure they are all named
              correctly, are located in the proper place, and that there is
              sufficient disk space to hold them all.  You make the appropriate
              changes to the configuration file(s).  Finally, you run any setup
              programs that are necessary, giving them whatever information they
              require to do their job.
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>              You let the computer do it.
            </P
></LI
></OL
>

        If it seems like the first choice isn't so bad, consider how many files
        you'll need to keep track of.  On a typical Linux system, it's not
        unusual to have over 20,000 different files.  That's a
        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>lot</I
> of documentation reading, file copying, and
        configuring!  And what happens when you want a newer version of a
        program?  More of the same!
      </P
><P

        them.

>Enter the Package</A
></H2
><P
>          When you consider that computers are very good at keeping track of
          large amounts of data, the idea of giving your computer the job of
          riding herd over 20,000 files seems like a good one.  And that's
          exactly what package management software does.  But what
          <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>is</I
> a "package"?
        </P
><P
>          A package in the computer sense is very similar to a package in the
          physical sense.  Both are methods of keeping related objects together
          in the same place.  Both need to be opened before the contents can be
          used.  Both can have a "packing slip" taped to the side, identifying
          the contents.
        </P
><P
>          Normally, package management systems take all the various files
          containing programs, data, documentation, and configuration
          information, and place them in one specially formatted file &#8212; a
          package file.  In the case of RPM, the package file is sometimes
          called a "package", a ".rpm file", or even an "RPM".  All mean the
          same thing &#8212; a package containing software meant to be installed
          using RPM.
        </P
><P
>          What types of software are normally found in a package?  There are no
          hard and fast rules, but normally a package's contents consist of one
          of the following types of software:

          <P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>                A collection of one or more programs that perform a single
                well-defined task.  This is normally what people think of as an
                "application".  Word processors and programming languages would
                fit into this category.

                system initialization scripts, a particular command shell, or
                the software required to support a web server, for example.

></H3
><P
>            One of the most obvious benefits to having a package is that the
            package is one easily manageable chunk.  If you move it from one
            place to another, there's no risk of any part getting left behind.
            But although this is the most obvious advantage, it's not the
            biggest one.
          </P
><P
>            The biggest advantage is that the package can contain the
            <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>knowledge</I
> about what it takes to install itself
            on your computer.  And if the package contains the steps required to
            install itself, the package can also contain the steps required to
            uninstall itself.  What used to be a painful manual process is now a
            straightforward procedure.  What used to be a mass of 20,000 files
            becomes a couple hundred packages.

          packages has decreased the complexity of managing a system by an order
          of magnitude, it hasn't yet gotten to the level of being a
          "no-brainer".  It's still necessary to keep track of what packages are
          installed on your system.  And if there are some packages that require
          other packages in order to install or operate correctly, these should
          be tracked as well.

                  version.  You'll probably want to install the new version and
                  remove the old one.

                  do with that disk space, so get rid of it!

                  the date the package was installed, to a list of files it

                  package installed, it might be handy to be able to name a
                  particular file and find out which package installed it.

                  all unusual to make a mistake and delete one file &#8212; or a
                  hundred.  Being able to tell if one or more packages are
                  missing files could greatly simplify the process of getting an
                  ailing system back on its feet again.
