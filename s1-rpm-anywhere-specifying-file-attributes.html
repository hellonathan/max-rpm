>          There are a couple other wrinkles to using the
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%attr</B
> macro.  If a particular file attribute
          doesn't need to be specified, that attribute can be replaced with a
          dash "<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-</B
>" and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%attr</B
> will not
          change it.  Say, for instance, that a package's files are installed
          with the permissions correctly set, as they almost always are.
          Instead of having to go to the trouble of entering the permissions for
          each and every file, each file can have the same
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%attr</B
>:

        </P
><P
>          The other wrinkle is that, although we've been showing the three file
          attributes separated by commas, in reality they could be separated by
          spaces as well.  Whichever delimiter you choose, it pays to be
          consistent throughout a spec file.

><P
>          A couple points are worth noting here.  The line for
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README</TT
> shows that multiple macros can be used on
          a line &#8212; in this case, one to set file attributes, and one to
          mark the file as being documentation.  The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%attr</B
>
          for <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/bin/cdp</TT
> declares the file to be
          setuid root.  If it sends a shiver down your spine to know that
          anybody can create a package that will run setuid root when installed
          on your system &#8212; Good!  Just because RPM makes it easy to
          install software doesn't mean that you should blindly install every
          package you find.

          <TT

          Looking back even further, it's there in the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%attr</B
>
          for that file.  Must have been a typo.  We could pretend that RPM used
          advanced artificial intelligence technology to come to the same
          conclusion as we did and made the appropriate change, but in reality,
          RPM simply used the only group identifier it could count on &#8212;
          root.  RPM will do the same thing if it can't resolve a user
          specification.

          the user may not have the same uid/gid from system to system.  There
