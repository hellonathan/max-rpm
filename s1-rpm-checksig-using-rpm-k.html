>        After all the preliminaries with PGP, it's time to get down to business.
        First, we need to get the package builder's public key and add it to the
        public keyring file used by RPM.  You'll need to do this once for each
        package builder whose packages you'll want to check.  This is what
        you'll need to do:

>          With a bit of digging, we can see that each of the three tests was
          performed, and each passed.  The reason for that dire-sounding warning
          is that PGP is meant to operate without a central authority managing
          key distribution.  PGP certifies keys based on <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>webs of
          trust</I
>.  For example, if an acquaintance of yours creates a
          public key, you can certify it by attaching your digital signature to
          it.  Then anyone that knows and trusts you can also trust your
          acquaintance's public key.

          If someone was trying to masquerade as Red Hat then they have certainly
          gone through a lot of trouble to do so.  In this case, the lack of a
          certified public key is not a major problem, given the fact that the
          CDROM came directly from the Red Hat offices.

          been changed.  The fact that the package's MD5 checksum also failed to
          verify provides further evidence that the bogus package is just that:

          block, containing size, MD5 checksum, and PGP signature information.
          The size of the signature, the size of the package file's header and
          archive sections, and the expected size of those sections are all
          displayed.
