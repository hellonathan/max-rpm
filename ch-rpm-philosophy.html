><P
>      As we saw in the first half of this book, RPM can make life much easier
      for the user.  With automated installs, upgrades, and erasures, RPM can
      take a lot of the guesswork out of keeping a computer system up-to-date.
    </P
><P
>      But what about people that sling code for a living?  Does RPM have
      anything to offer them?  The answer is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>yes</I
>!  One of
      the best things about RPM is that although it was designed to make life
      easier for users, it was written by people that would be using it to build
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>many</I
> packages.  So the design philosophy of RPM has a
      definite bias toward making life easier for developers.  Here are some of
      the reasons you should consider building packages with RPM:

></H1
><P
>        While many developers might use RPM to package their own software, just
        as many, if not more, are going to be packaging software that they have
        not written.  Because of this, there are some aspects to RPM's design
        that are geared toward "third-party" package builders.  One such aspect
        is RPM's use of "pristine" sources.
      </P
><P
>        When a third-party package builder decides to package someone else's
        software, they often get the software from the Net, normally as a
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
> file compressed with something like GNU zip.
        That's probably about the only generalization we can make when talking
        about software that is eligible for packaging.  Once we look inside the
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
> file, there are a world of possible differences:

        <P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The application could be available in pure source form, in pure
              binary form, or some combination of both.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The application might have been written to be built using
              <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>imake</B
>, or a script
              included with the sources.  Or, it might have to be built entirely
              by hand.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The application might need to be configured prior to use.  Maybe
              it uses GNU <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B
>, a custom configuration
              script, or one or more files that need to be edited to reflect the
              target environment.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The application might have been written to reside in specific
              directories, and those directories do not exist, or are not
              appropriate on the target system.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The application might not even support the target environment,
              requiring all manner of changes to port it to the target
              environment.
            </P

      </P
><P
>        We could go on, but you probably get the idea.  It's a rare application
        that comes off the Net ready to package, and the changes required vary
        widely.  What to do?
      </P
><P
>        This is where the concept of pristine sources comes in.  RPM has been
        designed to use the sources as they come from the application's
        developer, no matter how it has been packaged and configured.  The main
        benefit is that the changes you as a package builder need to make,
        remain separate from the original sources, in a distinct collection of
        patches.
      </P
><P
>        This may not sound like much of an advantage, but consider how this
        would work if a new version of the application came out.  If the new
        version had a few localized bug fixes, it's entirely possible the
        original patches could be applied, and a new package built, with a
        single RPM command.  Even if the patches didn't apply cleanly, it would
        at least give an indication as to what might need to be done to get the
        new version built and packaged.
      </P
><P
>        If your users sometimes customize packages, having pristine sources
        makes it easier for them, too.  They can see what patches you've created
        and can easily add their own.
      </P
><P
>        Another benefit to using pristine sources is that it makes keeping track
        of multiple versions of a package simple.  Instead of keeping patched
        sources around, or battling a revision control system, it's only
        necessary to keep:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The original sources in their tar file.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              A copy of the patches you applied to get the application to build.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              A file used by RPM to control the package building process.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>        With these three items, it's possible to easily build the package at any
        time.  Keeping track of multiple versions only entails keeping track of
        each version of these three components, rather than hundreds or
        thousands of patched source files.
      </P
><P
>        In fact, it gets better than that.  RPM can also build a source package
        containing these three components.  The source package, named using
        RPM's standard naming convention, keeps everything you need to recreate
        a specific version of a package, in one uniquely named file.  Keeping
        track of multiple versions of multiple packages is simply a matter of
        keeping the appropriate source packages around.  Everything else can be
        built from them.
