>      PGP, or "Pretty Good Privacy", is a program that is intended to help
      make electronic mail more secure.  It does this by using sophisticated
      techniques known as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>public key encryption</I
>.
    </P
><P
>      If you find yourself wondering what electronic mail and making
      information unreadable by spies has to do with RPM, you have a good
      point.  However, although PGP's claim to fame is the handling of e-mail
      in total privacy, it has some other tricks up its sleeve.

        magic.  You might guess from the name that this type of encryption
        involves keys of some sort.  But, as you might imagine, these are not
        keys that you can copy down at the local hardware store.  They are

>        PGP uses two different types of keys: public and private.  The public
        key, as its name suggests, can be shared with anyone.  The key shown
        above is, in fact, a public key.  The private key, as
        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>its</I
> name suggests, should be kept a secret.  PGP
        creates keys in pairs &#8212; one private and one public.  A key pair
        must remain a pair; if one is lost, the other by itself is useless.
        Why?  Because the two keys have an interesting property that can be
        exploited in two ways:

        <P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              A message encrypted by a given <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>public</I
> key
              can only be decrypted with the corresponding
              <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>private</I
> key.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              A message encrypted by a given <I

              can only be decrypted with the corresponding
              <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>public</I
> key.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>        In the case of sending messages in total privacy, the key pairs are
        used in the first manner.  It allows two people to exchange private
        messages without first exchanging any "secret codes".  The only
        requirement is that each know the other's public key.
      </P
><P
>        However, for RPM, the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>second</I
> method is the
        important one.  Let's say a company needs to send you a document, and
        you'd like to make sure it really did come from them.  If the company
        first encrypted the file with their private key and sent it to you,
        you would have an encrypted file you couldn't read.
      </P
><P
>        Or could you?  If you have the company's <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>public</I
>
        key, you should be able to decrypt it.  In fact, if you can't, you can
        be sure that the message you received did <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
>
        come from them

        !
      </P
><P
>        It is this feature that is used by RPM.  By using PGP's public key
        encryption, it is possible to not only prove that a package file came
        from a certain person or persons, but also that it was not changed
        somewhere along the line.

><P
>        In a word, no.  Rather than being encrypted, RPM package files possess
        a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>digital signature</I
>.  This is a way of using
        encryption to attach a signature (again, basically a large number) to
        some information, such that:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The signature cannot be separated from the information.  Any
              attempt to verify the signature against any other information
              will fail.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The signature can only be produced by one private key.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>        In the case of RPM, the information being signed is the contents of
        the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.rpm</TT
> file itself.
      </P
><P
>        A digital signature is just like a regular signature.  It doesn't
        obscure the contents of the document being signed, it just provides a
        method of determining the authenticity of a document.  Here is an
        example of a digital signature turned into printable text:

        However, RPM has no formal requirement that this be the case.  There is
        also no requirement that you do anything special with a signed .rpm
        file.  Think of it as an extra feature that you can take advantage of,
        or not &#8212; it's strictly your choice.
