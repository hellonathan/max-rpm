        is to identify the build platform.  This is done by matching information

        entries that support all platforms that currently run RPM.  However,
        when adding support for new platforms, it will be necessary to use the
        following entries to add support for the new build platform.

>          By using the <TT

          RPM usually makes the right decisions in selecting the build and
          install platforms.  However, there might be times when RPM's
          selections aren't the best.  Normally the circumstances are unusual,
          as in the case of cross-compiling software.  In these cases, it is
          nice to have an easy way of overriding the build-time architecture and
          operating system.
        </P
><P
>          The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--buildarch</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--buildos</B
>
          options can be used to set the build-time architecture and operating
          system rather than relying on RPM's automatic detection capabilities.
          These options are added to a normal RPM build command.  One important
          point to remember is that, although RPM does try to find the specified
          architecture name, it does no checking as to the sanity of the entered
          architecture or operating system.  For example, if you enter an
          entirely fictional operating system, RPM will issue a warning message,
          and then happily build a package for it.
        </P
><P
>          Why?  Wouldn't it make more sense for RPM to perform some sort of
          sanity check?  In a word, no.  One of RPM's main design goals was to
          never get in the way of the package builder.  If someone has a need to
          override their build platform information, they should know what
          they're doing, and what the full implications of their actions are.
