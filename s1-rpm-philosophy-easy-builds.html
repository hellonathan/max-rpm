>        RPM makes it easy to build packages.  Just as with the use of pristine
        sources, the fact that the build process is simple is an even greater
        advantage to the third-party package builders responsible for many
        packages, than it is to a one-package software development house.  But
        in either case, RPM's ease of building is a welcome relief.  The
        following sections document some of the ways that RPM makes building
        packages a straightforward process.

>          One of the biggest problems facing developers is reproducing a
          particular build.  This single problem is the main reason so much
          effort is put into creating and deploying version control systems to
          manage sources.

>          While RPM cannot compete with a full-blown revision control system, it
          does an excellent job of keeping in one place everything required to
          build a particular version of a package.  Remember the source package
          we mentioned above?  With one command, RPM can open the package,
          extract the sources, patch them, perform a build, and create a new
          binary package, ready for your users.  The best part is that the
          binary package will be the same <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>every</I
> time you
          build it because everything needed to create it is kept in one source
          package.

>          As we mentioned above, completely building a package takes only one
          RPM command.  This makes it easy to set up automated build procedures
          that can build one hundred packages as easily as one.  Anything from a
          single package consisting of one application to the several hundred
          packages that comprise an entire operating system, can be built
          automatically using RPM.
