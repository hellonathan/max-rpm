>        Writing a book is similar to entering a long-term relationship with an
        obsessive partner.  Throughout the nine months it took to write this
        book, life went on: job changes, births, deaths, and even a hurricane.
        Throughout it all, the book demanded constant attention.  Therefore, I'd
        like to thank the people that made it possible to focus on the book to
        the exclusion of nearly everything else.  My wife, Deb and son, Matt
        supported and encouraged me throughout, even when I was little more than
        a reclusive houseguest hunched over the computer in the study.
        Additionally, Deb acted as my editor and indexer, eventually reading the
        book completely three times!  Thank you both.

>        Thanks also to 
        
        Marc Ewing and 
        
        Erik Troan, RPM architects extraordinaire.  Without their programming
        savvy, RPM wouldn't be the elegant tool it is.  Without their boundless
        patience, my many questions would have gone unanswered, and this book
        would have been much less than it is now.  I hope you find this book a
        worthy companion to your programming handiwork.

        RPM's ancestors.  Thank you!

>        Finally a great big thank you goes to Jessica and the gang at L'il
        Dinos, Jennifer and her crew at the Cary Barnes &#38; Noble coffee shop,
        and Mom and her "kids" at Schlotzsky's Deli in Durham.  If all of you
        hadn't let me sit around for hours writing, this book wouldn't be nearly
        as fat as it is.  And neither would I!
