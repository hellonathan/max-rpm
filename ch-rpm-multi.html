>      While RPM certainly makes packaging software as easy as possible, it
      doesn't end there.  RPM gives you the tools you need to build a package on
      different types of computers.  More importantly, RPM makes it possible to
      build packages on different types of computers <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>using a single
      spec file</I
>.  Those of you that have developed software for
      different computers know the importance of maintaining a single set of
      sources.  RPM lets you continue that practice through the package building
      phase.
    </P
><P
>      Before we get into RPM's capabilities, let's do a quick review of what is
      involved in developing software for different types of computer systems.

><P
>        From a software engineering standpoint, there are only two major
        differences between any two computer systems:

        <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>              The architecture implemented by the computer's hardware.
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>              The system software running on the computer.
            </P
></LI
></OL
>
      </P
><P
>        The first difference is built into the computer.  The architecture is
        the manner in which the computer system was designed.  It includes the
        number and type of registers present in the processor, the number of
        machine instructions, what operations they perform, and so on.  For
        example, every "PC" today, no matter who built it, is based on the Intel
        x86 architecture.
      </P
><P
>        The second difference is more under our control.  The operating system
        is software that controls how the system operates.  Different operating
        systems have different methods of storing information on disk, different
        ways of implementing functions used by programs, and different hardware
        requirements.
      </P
><P
>        As far as package building is concerned, two systems with the same
        architecture running two different operating systems, are as different
        as two systems with different architectures running the same operating
        system.  In the first case, the software being packaged for different
        operating systems will differ due to the differences between the
        operating systems.  In the second case, the software being packaged for
        different architectures will differ due to the underlying differences in
        hardware.

        If there is a tag, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rpmrc</TT
> file entry, or conditional
        that is used to support architectural differences, there is a
        corresponding tag, entry, or conditional that supports operating system
        differences.

          refer to a computer of a given architecture running a given operating
          system as a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>platform</I
>.  If another system
          differs in either aspect, it is considered a different platform.

          RPM's multi-platform capabilities.
