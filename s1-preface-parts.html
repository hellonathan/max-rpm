>        This book is divided into two major sections.  The first section is for
        anyone that needs to know how to use RPM on their system.  Given the
        state of the GNU/Linux arena today, this could mean just about anyone,
        including people that are new to GNU/Linux, or even UNIX.  So those of
        you that think that

         is serious magic (or maybe even a typing error), relax &#8212; we'll
         explain everything you'll need to know in the first section.

>        In the book's second half, we'll be covering all there is to know about
        building packages using RPM.  Since software engineering on GNU/Linux
        and UNIX systems requires in-depth knowledge of the operating system,
        available tools, and basic programming concepts, we're going to assume
        that the reader has sufficient background in these areas.  Feel free to
        browse through the second half, but don't hesitate to seek additional
        sources of information if you find the going a bit tough.
