>        There are several ways to verify packages installed on your system.  If
        you've taken a look at RPM's query command, you'll find that many of
        them are similar.  Let's start with the simplest method of specifying
        packages &#8212; the package label.

          or part of a package label.  As with every other RPM command that
          accepts package labels, you'll need to carefully specify each part of
          the label you include.  Keep in mind that package names are
          case-sensitive, so <B

>          When a package is built, the package builder must classify the
          package, grouping it with other packages that perform similar
          functions.  RPM gives you the ability to verify installed packages
          based on their groups.  For example, there is a group known as
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Shells</TT
>.  This group consists of packages that
          contain, strangely enough, shells.  Let's verify the proper
          installation of every shell-related package on the system:
