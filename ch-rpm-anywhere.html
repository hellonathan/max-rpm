>Chapter 16. Making a Package That Can Build Anywhere</H1
><P
>      While RPM makes building packages as easy as possible, some of the default
      design decisions might not work well in a particular situation.  Here are
      two situations where RPM's method of package building may cause problems:

      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>            You are unable to dedicate a system to RPM package building, or the
            software you're packaging would disrupt the build system's operation
            if it were installed.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            You would like to package software, but you don't have root access
            to an appropriate build system.
          </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>      Either of these situations can be resolved by directing RPM to build,
      install, and package the software in a different area on your build
      system. It requires a bit of additional effort to accomplish this, but
      taken a step at a time, it is not difficult.  Basically, the process can
      be summed up by addressing the following steps:

      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>            Writing the package's spec file to support a build root.
          </P
></LI
><LI

          </P
></LI

STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>            Specifying file attributes that RPM needs to set on installation.
          </P
></LI
></UL
>
    </P
><P
>      The methods discussed here are not required in every situation.  For
      example, a system administrator developing a package on a production
      system may only need to add support for a build root.  On the other hand,
      a student wishing to build a package on a university system will need to
      get around the lack of root access by implementing every method described
      here.

NAME="S1-RPM-ANYWHERE-USING-BUILD-ROOTS"
>Using Build Roots in a Package</A
></H1
><P
>        Part of the process of packaging software with RPM is to actually build
        the software and install it on the build system.  The installation of
        software can only be accomplished by someone with root access, so a
        non-privileged user will certainly need to handle RPM's installation
        phase differently.  There are times, however, when even a person with
        root access will not want RPM to copy new files into the system's
        directories.  As mentioned above, the reasons might be due to the fact
        that the software being packaged is already in use on the build system.
        Another reason might be as mundane as not having enough free space
        available to perform the install into the default directories.
      </P
><P
>        Whatever the reason, RPM provides the ability to direct a given package
        to install into an alternate root.  This alternate root is known as a
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>build root</I
>.  Several requirements must be met in
        order for a build root to be utilized:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              A default build root must be defined in the package's spec file.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The installation method used by the software being packaged must
              be able to support installation in an alternate root.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>        The first part is easy.  It entails adding the following line to the
        spec file:

        <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"

        </PRE
></TD

>
      </P
><P
>        Of course, you would replace <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>&#60;root&#62;</I
></TT
>
        with the name of the directory in which you'd like the software to
        install.
        <A
NAME="AEN10138"
HREF="#FTN.AEN10138"
><SPAN
CLASS="footnote"
>[1]</SPAN
></A
>
        If, for example, you specify a build root of
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/tmp/foo</TT
>, and the software you're packaging
        installs a file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bar</TT
> in
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/bin</TT
>, you'll find <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bar</TT
>
        residing in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/tmp/foo/usr/bin</TT
> after the build.
      </P
><P
>        A note for you non-root package builders: make sure you can actually
        write to the build root you specify!  Those of you with root access
        should also make sure you choose your build root carefully.  For an
        assortment of reasons, it's <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> a good idea to
        declare a build root of "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>"!  We'll get into the
        reasons why shortly.
      </P
><P
>        The final requirement for adding build root support is to make sure the
        software's installation method can support installing into an alternate
        root.  The difficulty in meeting this requirement can range from dead
        simple to nearly impossible.  There are probably as many different ways
        of approaching this as there are packages to build.  But in general,
        some variant of the following approach is used:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The environment variable <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>RPM_BUILD_ROOT</CODE
> is set by
              RPM and contains the value of the build root to be used when the
              software is built and installed.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%install</B

              modified to use <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>RPM_BUILD_ROOT</CODE
> as part of the
              installation process.
            </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              If the software is installed using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
>, the
              makefile is modified to use <CODE

>RPM_BUILD_ROOT</CODE
> and to
              create any directories that may not exist at installation time.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>        Here's an example of how these components work together to utilize a
        build root.  First, there's the definition of the build root in the spec
        file:

        <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>BuildRoot: /tmp/cdplayer</SAMP
>
        </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>        This line defines the build root as being
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/tmp/cdplayer</TT
>.  All the files installed by this
        software will be placed under the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cdplayer</TT
>
        directory.  Next is the spec file's <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%install</B
> section:

        <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>%install
make ROOT="$RPM_BUILD_ROOT" install</SAMP
>
        </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>        Since the software we're packaging uses <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> to
        perform the actual install, we simply define the environment variable
        <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>ROOT</CODE
> to be the path defined by
        <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>RPM_BUILD_ROOT</CODE
>.  So far, so good.  Things really start to
        get interesting in the software's <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
>, though:

        <TABLE

      </P
><P
>        In the example above, the commented lines were the original ones.  The
        uncommented lines perform the same function, but also support
        installation in the root specified by the environment variable
        <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>ROOT</CODE
>.
      </P
><P
>        One point worth noting is that the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> now
        takes extra pains to make sure the proper directory structure exists
        before installing any files.  This is often necessary, as build roots
        are deleted, in most cases, after the software has been packaged.  This
        is why <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

        option &#8212; to make sure the necessary directories have been created.

        us.  It starts by making sure there is no pre-existing documentation
        directory.  Next, RPM creates the documentation directory and copies
        files into it.

>        The remainder of this example is identical to that of a package being
        built without a build root being specified.  However, although the
        output is identical, there is one crucial difference.  When the binary
        package is created, instead of simply using each line in the
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%files</B
> list verbatim, RPM prepends the build root
        path first.  If this wasn't done, RPM would attempt to find the files,
        relative to the system's root directory, and would, of course, fail.
        Because of the automatic prepending of the build root, it's important to
        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> include the build root path in any
        <B

>          Once the necessary modifications have been made to support a build
          root, it's necessary for the package builder to keep some issues in
          mind.  The first is that the build root specified in the spec file can
          be overridden.  RPM will set the build root (and therefore, the value
          of <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>$RPM_BUILD_ROOT</CODE
>) to one of the following values:

>
        </P
><P
>          Because of this, it's important that the spec file and the makefile be
          written in such a way that no assumptions about the build root are
          made.  The main issue is that the build root must not be hard-coded
          anywhere.  Always use the <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>RPM_BUILD_ROOT</CODE
> environment
          variable!
        </P
><P
>          Another issue to keep in mind is cleaning up after the build.  Once
          software builds and is packaged successfully, it's probably no longer
          necessary to leave the build root in place.  Therefore, it's a good
          idea to include the necessary commands in the spec file's
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%clean</B
> section.  Here's an example:

><P
>          Since RPM executes the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%clean</B
> section after the
          binary package has been created, it's the perfect place to delete the
          build root tree.  In the example above, that's exactly what we're
          doing.  We're also doing the right thing by using the
          <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>RPM_BUILD_ROOT</CODE
>, instead of a hard-coded path.
          
        </P
><P
>          The last issue to keep in mind revolves around the
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%clean</B
> section we just created.  At the start of
          the chapter, we mentioned that it's not a good idea to define a build
          root of "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>".  The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%clean</B
>
          section is why: If the build root was set to "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>",
          the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%clean</B
> section would blow away your root
          filesystem!  Keep in mind that this can bite you, even if the
          package's spec file doesn't specify "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>" as a
          build root.  It's possible to use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--buildroot</B
>
          option to specify a dangerous build root, too:

>          But for all the possible hazards using build roots can pose for the
          careless, it's the only way to prevent a build from disrupting the
          operation of certain packages on the build system.  And for the person
          wanting to build packages without root access, it's the first of three
          steps necessary to accomplish the task.  The next step is to direct
