><P
>      Since the very first version of RPM hit the streets, one of the side
      effects of RPM's ease of use was that it made it easier for people to
      break things.  Since RPM made it so simple to erase packages, it became
      common for people to joyfully erase packages until something broke.
    </P
><P
>      Usually this only bit people once, but even once was too much of a hassle
      if it could be prevented.  With this in mind, the RPM developers gave RPM
      the ability to:

      <P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>            Build packages that contain information on the capabilities they
            require.
          </P
></LI

STYLE="list-style-type: disc"

>            Build packages that contain information on the capabilities they
            provide.
          </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>            Store this "provides" and "requires" information in the RPM
            database.
          </P
></LI
></UL
>
    </P
><P
>      In addition, they made sure RPM was able to display dependency
      information, as well as to warn users if they were attempting to do
      something that would break a package's dependency requirements.
    </P
><P
>      With these features in place, it became more difficult for someone to
      unknowingly erase a package and wreak havoc on their system.

><P
>        We've already alluded to the underlying concept for RPM's dependency
        processing.  It is based on two key factors:

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              Packages advertise what capabilities they provide.

STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>              Packages advertise what capabilities they require.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>        By simply checking these two types of information, many possible
        problems can be avoided.  For example, if a package requires a
        capability that is not provided by any already-installed package, that
        package cannot be installed and expected to work properly.
      </P
><P
>        On the other hand, if a package is to be erased, but its capabilities
        are required by other installed packages, then it cannot be erased
        without causing other packages to fail.
      </P
><P
>        As you might imagine, it's not quite <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>that</I
> simple.
        But adding dependency information can be easy.  In fact, in most cases,
        it's automatic!
