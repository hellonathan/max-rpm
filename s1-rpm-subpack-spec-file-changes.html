>        The creation of subpackages is based strictly on the contents of the
        spec file.  This doesn't mean that you'll have to learn an entirely new
        set of tags, conditionals, and directives in order to create
        subpackages.  In fact, you'll only need to learn one.
      </P

>        The primary change to a spec file is structural and starts with the
        definition of a preamble for each subpackage.

></H2
><P
>          When we introduced RPM package building in <A
HREF="ch-rpm-basics.html"
>Chapter 10</A
>, we said that every spec file contains a
          preamble.  The preamble contains a variety of tags that define all
          sorts of information about the package.  In a single package
          situation, the preamble must be at the start of the spec file.  The
          spec file we're creating will have one there, too.
        </P
><P
>          When creating a spec file that will build subpackages, each subpackage
          also needs a preamble of its own.  These "sub-preambles" need only
          define information for the subpackage when that information differs
          from what is defined in the main preamble.  For example, if we wanted
          to define an installation prefix for a subpackage, we would add the
          appropriate <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>prefix</B
> tag to that subpackage's
          preamble.
          
          That subpackage would then be relocatable.
        </P
><P
>          In a single-package spec file, there is nothing that explicitly
          identifies the preamble, other than its position at the top of the
          file.  For subpackages, however, we need to be a bit more explicit.
          So we use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%package</B
> directive to identify the
          preamble for each subpackage.

><P
>            The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%package</B
> directive actually performs two
            functions.  As we mentioned above, it is used to denote the start of
            a subpackage's preamble.  It also plays a role in forming the
            subpackage's name.  As an example, let's say the main preamble
            contains the following <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>name</B
> tag:

          </P
><P
>            In this way, it's easy to see the relationship of the subpackage to
            the main package (or other subpackages, for that matter).  Of
            course, this naming convention might not be appropriate in every
            case.  So there is an option to the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%package</B
>
            directive for just this circumstance.

            the main package.
          </P
><P
>            One of the time-saving aspects of using subpackages is that there is
            no need to duplicate information for each subpackage if it is
            already defined in the main package.  Therefore, since the main
            package's preamble has a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>version</B
> tag defining the
            version as 2.7, the two subpackages that lack a
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>version</B
> tag in their preambles will simply
            inherit the main package's version definition.
          </P
><P
>            Since the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bazlib</TT
> subpackage's preamble contains
            a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>version</B
> tag, it must have its own unique
            version.
          </P
><P
>            In addition, each subpackage must have its own
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>summary</B
> tag.
          </P
><P
>            So based on these requirements, our spec file now looks like this:

            difference is that the <B

          interacting with each other.  Of course, this is simply good
          script-writing practice, even if the packages involved are not
          related.
