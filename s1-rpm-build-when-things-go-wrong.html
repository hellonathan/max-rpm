>          As we alluded to earlier in the chapter, RPM can stop at various
          points in the build process.  This allows package builders to look
          through the build directory and make sure everything is proceeding
          properly.  If there are problems, stopping during the build process
          permits them to see exactly what is going wrong, and where.  Here is a
          list of points RPM can be stopped at during the build:

              </P

        </P
><P
>          In addition, there is also a method that permits the package builder
          to "short circuit" the build process and direct RPM to skip over the
          initial steps.  This is handy when the application is not yet ready
          for packaging and needs some fine tuning.  This way, once the package
          builds, installs, and operates properly, the required patches to the
          original sources can be created, and plugged into the package's spec
          file.

>          Of course, the fact that an application has been packaged successfully
          doesn't necessarily mean that it will operate correctly when the
          package is actually installed.  Testing is required.  In the case of
          our example, it's perfect and doesn't need such testing.

          But here is how testing would proceed:
        </P
><P
>          The first step is to find a test system.  If you thought of simply
          using the build system, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>bzzzzt</I
>, try again!  Think
          about it &#8212; in the course of building the package, the build
          system actually had the application installed on it.  That is how RPM
          gets the files that are to be packaged: by building the software,
          installing it, and grabbing copies of the installed files, which are
          found using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%files</B
> list.
        </P
><P
>          Some of you dissenters that have read the first half of the book might
          be thinking, "Why not just install the package on the build system
          using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--replacefiles</B
> option?  That way, it'll
          just blow away the files installed by the build process and replace
          them with the packaged files."  Well, you folks get a
          <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>bzzzzt</I
>, too!  Here's why.
        </P
><P
>          Say, for example, that the software you're packaging installs a bunch
          of files &#8212; maybe a hundred.  What does this mean?  Well for one
          thing, it means that the package's <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%files</B
> list is
          going to be quite large.  For another thing, the sheer number of files
          makes it likely that you'll miss one or two.  What would happen then?
        </P
><P
>          When RPM builds the software, there's no problem: the software builds,
          and the application's makefile merrily installs all the files.  The
          next step in RPM's build process is to collect the files by reading
          the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%files</B
> list, and to add each file listed to a
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cpio</B
> archive.  What happens to the files you've
          missed?  Nothing &#8212; they aren't added to the package file, but
          they <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>are</I
> on your build system, installed just
          where they should be.
        </P
><P
>          Next, when the package is installed using
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--replacefiles</B
>, RPM dutifully installs each of the
          packaged files, replacing the ones originally installed on the build
          system.  The missed files?  They aren't overwritten by RPM since they
          weren't in the package.  But they're still on disk, right where the
          application expects them to be!  If you go to test the application
          then, it will find every file it needs.  But not every file came from
          the package.  Bad news!  Using a different system on which the
          application had never been built is one sure way to test for missing
          files.
        </P

>          That wraps up our fictional build.  Now that we have some experience
          with RPM's build process, we can take a more in-depth look at RPM's
          build command.
