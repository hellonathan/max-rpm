          does not have a method of automatically determining file types.
          Therefore, it is up to the package builder to appropriately mark files
          in the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%files</B
> list.  This is done using one of the
          directives below.
        </P

          the following sections, you'll see that directives are only used in
          special circumstances.  In most packages, the majority of files in the
          <B

><P
>            The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

            follow, as being documentation.  RPM keeps track of documentation
            files in its database, so that a user can easily find information
            about an installed package.  In addition, RPM can create a
            package-specific documentation directory during installation and
            copy documentation into it.  Whether or not this additional step is
            taken, is dependent on how a file is specified.  Here is an example:

CLASS="FILENAME"
>README</TT
> exists in the software's
            top-level directory during the build, and is included in the package
            file.  When the package is installed, RPM creates a directory in the
            documentation directory named the same as the package (ie,
            <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"

            created directory and the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README</TT

            marked in the RPM database as being documentation.  The default
            documentation directory is <TT

            changed by setting the <B

            owner/group and give out a false alarm.  Instead, the following

            own documentation directory and contains a large number of files.
