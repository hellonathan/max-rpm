>        While we are primarily concerned with RPM's advantages from the
        developer's point of view, it's worth looking at RPM from the user's
        standpoint for a moment.  After all, if RPM makes life easier for your
        users, that can translate into lower support costs.

><P
>          Probably the biggest headache for user and developer alike is the
          upgrade of an application, or worse yet, an entire operating system!
          RPM can make upgrading a one-step process.  With one command, a new
          package can be installed, and the remnants of the old package removed.

>          Configuration files &#8212; nearly every application has them.  They
          may go by different names, but they all control the behavior of their
          application.  Users normally customize config files to their liking
          and would be upset if their customizations were lost during the
          installation, upgrade, or removal of a package.
        </P
><P
>          RPM takes special care with a user's config files.  By using MD5
          checksums, RPM can determine what action is most appropriate with a
          config file.  If a config file has been modified by the user and has
          to be replaced, it is saved.  That way a user's modifications are
          never lost.

>          RPM uses a database to keep track of all files it installs.  RPM's
          database provides other benefits, such as the wide variety of
          information that can be easily retrieved from it.  RPM's query command
          makes it easy for users to quickly answer a number of questions, such
          as:

          <P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>                Where did this file come from?  Is it part of a package?

></LI

></UL
>
        </P
><P
>          These are just a few examples of the many ways RPM can provide
          information about one or more packages on a user's system.

>Easy Package Verification</A
></H2
><P
>          Another way that RPM leverages the information stored in its database,
          is by providing an easy way to verify that a package is properly
          installed.  With this capability, RPM makes it easy to determine, for
          example, what packages were damaged by a wildcard delete in
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/bin</TT
>.  In addition, RPM's verification
          command can detect changes to file attributes, such as a file's
          permissions, ownership, and size.
