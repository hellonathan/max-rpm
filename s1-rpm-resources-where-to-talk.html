>      As much as we've tried to make this book a comprehensive reference for
      RPM, there are going to be times when you'll need additional help.  The
      best way to connect with other that use RPM is to try one of the following
      mailing lists.

>        Red Hat maintains a mailing list specifically for RPM.  In order to
        subscribe to the list, it's necessary to send a mail message to:

        <TABLE

CLASS="SCREEN"

></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>        On the message's subject line, place the word
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>subscribe</B
>.  After a short delay, you should receive
        an automated response with general information about the mailing list.
      </P
><P
>        To send messages to the list, address them to:

>
      </P
><P
>        As with other on-line forums, it's advisable to "lurk" for a while
        before sending anything to the list.  That way, you'll be able to see
        what types of questions are acceptable for the list.  Let the list's
        name be your guide; if the message you want to send doesn't have
        anything to do with RPM, you shouldn't send it to
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rpm-list</TT
>!
      </P
><P
>        In general, the flavor of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rpm-list</TT
> is a bit biased
        towards RPM's development, building packages, and issues surrounding the
        porting of RPM to other systems.  If your question is more along the
        lines of, How do I use RPM to install new software? consider reviewing
        the first half of this book and lurking on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rpm-list</TT
>
        a while first.

>        The <TT

        forum for users of Red Hat's Linux operating system.  If your questions
        concerns the use of RPM on Red Hat Linux, then the

        there is a digest version of the list available.  Each digest consists
        of one or more messages sent to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>redhat-list</TT
>.  The
        digest is sent out when the collected messages reach a certain size.
        Therefore, a digest might have one very long message, or twenty smaller
        ones.  In either case, you'll have the collected knowledge of the Red Hat
        development team and their many customers delivered in one message.
