          isn't very flexible.  Let's look at an example.

          long.  But once a new version of RPM is created using this new

          file can have more than one header structure in it.  In fact, an RPM
          package file has two &#8212; the signature, and the header.  It was

        </P

>          Since the data type for this entry is a null-terminated string, we
          need to keep reading bytes until we reach a byte whose numeric value
          is zero.  We find the bytes <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>72</TT
>,
          <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>70</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>6d</TT
>, and
          <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>00</TT
> &#8212; a null.  Looking at the ASCII display on
          the right, we find that the bytes form the string
          <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm</TT
>, which is the name of this package.
        </P
><P
>          Now for a slightly more complicated example.  Let's look at the
          following index entry:

          </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
        </P
><P
>          Tag 403 means that this entry is a list of filenames.  The data type
          8, or STRING_ARRAY, seems to bear this out.  From the previous
          example, we found that the data area for the header began at offset
          370.  Adding the offset to the first filename (199), gives us 509.
          Finally, the count of 18 hex means that there should be 24
          null-terminated strings containing filenames:

>          The byte at offset 509 is 2f &#8212; a "/".  Reading up to the first
          null byte, we find that the first filename is
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin/rpm</TT
>, followed by
          <TT
