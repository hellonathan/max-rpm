        isn't much in the way of feedback, is there?  Could we get more if we

><P
>          By adding <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-vv</B
> to the command line, we can often get
          a better feel for what's going on inside RPM.  The
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-vv</B
> option was really meant for the RPM developers,
          and its output may change, but it is a great way to gain insight into
          RPM's inner workings.  Let's try it with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpm -e</B
>:

          Although <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-v</B
> had no effect on RPM's output,
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-vv</B
> gave us a torrent of output.  But what does it
          tell us?
        </P

>          First, RPM displays the package's record number.  The number is
          normally of use only to people that work on RPM's database code.
        </P
><P
>          Next, RPM executes a "pre-uninstall" script, if one exists.  This
          script can execute any commands required to remove the package before
          any files are actually deleted.
        </P
><P
>          The "<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>files test = 0</SAMP
>" line indicates
          that RPM is to actually erase the package.  If the number had been
          non-zero, RPM would only be performing a test of the package erasure.
          This happens when the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--test</B
> option is used.  Refer
          to <A
HREF="s1-rpm-erase-additional-options.html#S2-RPM-ERASE-TEST-OPTION"
>the Section called <I
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--test</B
> &#8212; Go Through the Process of Erasing
          the Package, But Do Not Erase It</I
></A
> for more information on
          the use of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--test</B
> option with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpm
          -e</B
>.
        </P
><P
>          The next two lines log the actual removal of the files comprising the
           package.  Packages with many files can result in a lot of output when
           using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-vv</B
>!
        </P
><P
>          Next, RPM executes a "post-uninstall" script, if one exists.  Like the
          pre-uninstall script, this script is used to perform any processing
          required to cleanly erase the package.  Unlike the pre-uninstall
          script, however, the post-uninstall script runs
          <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>after</I
> all the package's files have been removed.
        </P
><P
>          Finally, the last five lines show the process RPM uses to remove every
          trace of the package from its database.  From the messages, we can see
          that the database contains some per-package data, followed by
          information on every file installed by the package.
