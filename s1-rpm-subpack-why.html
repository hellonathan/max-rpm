>        If all the software in the world followed the usual "one source, one
        binary" structure, there would be no need for subpackages.  After all,
        RPM handles the building and packaging of a program into a single
        package file just fine.
      </P
><P
>        But software doesn't always conform to this simplistic structure.  It's
        not unusual for software to support two or more different modes of
        operation.  A client/server program, for example, comes in two flavors:
        a client, and a server.
      </P
><P
>        And it can get more complicated than that.  Sometimes software relies on
        another program so completely that the two cannot be built separately.
        The result is often several packages.
      </P
><P
>        While it is certainly possible that some convoluted procedure could be
        devised to force these kinds of software into a single-package
        structure, it makes more sense to let RPM manage the creation of
        subpackages.  Why?  From the package builder's viewpoint, the main
        reason to use subpackages is to eliminate any duplication of effort.
      </P
><P
>        By using subpackages, there's no need to maintain separate spec files
        and endure the resulting headaches when new versions of the software
        become available.  By keeping everything in one spec file, new software
        versions can be quickly integrated, and every related subpackage rebuilt
        with a single command.
      </P
><P
>        But that's enough of the preliminaries.  Let's see how subpackages are
        created.
