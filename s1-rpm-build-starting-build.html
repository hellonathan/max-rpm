        build area, removes any existing old sources, and extracts the sources
        from the original compressed tar file.  Although each file is listed as
        it is extracted, we've omitted most of the files listed, to save space.

        running <B

        means that RPM has not been directed to add a PGP signature to the
        package file.  During this time, however, RPM still adds two signatures
        that can be used to verify the size and the MD5 checksum of the package
        file.  Finally, we see confirmation that RPM has created the binary
        package file.

        files have been packaged.  There is no longer any need for any files

        sources extracted into RPM's build directory, we can see that, at worst,
        they will be removed the next time the package is built.  But what if

        original sources needed to be modified, the source package includes one
        or more patch files.  As when the binary package was created, we see
