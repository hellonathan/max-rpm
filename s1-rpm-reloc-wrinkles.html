          create the binary package file.  At that point RPM detected the

          line in the spec file (<TT

          present in the first part of the file's

>          While this section's title seems pretty obvious, it's not always easy
          to tell if a particular piece of software can be relocated.  Let's
          take a look at the question raised at the end of the previous section.
          If a program has been written to read its configuration file from
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
>, there are three possible approaches to
          making that program relocatable:

          <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>                Set the prefix to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
> and package
                everything under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
>.
              </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>                Package everything somewhere other than
                <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
> and leave out the config file
                entirely.
                
              </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>                Modify the program.
              </P
></LI
></OL
>
        </P
><P
>          The first approach would certainly work from a purely technical
          standpoint, but not many people would be happy with a program that
          installed itself in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
>.  So this approach isn't
          viable.
        </P
><P
>          The second approach might be more appropriate, but it forces users to
          complete the install by having them create the config file themselves.
          If RPM's goal is to make software easier to install and remove, this
          is not a viable approach, either!
        </P
><P
>          The final approach might be the best.  Once the program is installed,
          when the rewritten software is first run, it could see that no
          configuration file existed in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
>, and create
          one.
          
        </P
><P
>          However, even though this would work, when the time came to erase the
          package, the config file would be left behind.  RPM had never
          installed it, so RPM couldn't get rid of it.  There's also the fact
          that this approach is probably more labor intensive than most package
          builders would like.
        </P
><P
>          None of these approaches are very appealing, are they?  Some software
          just doesn't relocate very well.  In general, any of the following
          things are warning signs that relocation is going to be a problem:

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>                The software contains one or more files that must be installed
                in specific directories
              </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>                The software refers to system files using relative paths (Which
                is really just another way of saying the software must be
                installed in a particular directory)
              </P
></LI
></UL
>
        </P
><P
>          If these kinds of issues crop up, then making the software relocatable
          is going to be tough.  And there's still one issue left to consider.

>          Even assuming the software is written so that it can be put in a
          relocatable package, there still might be a problem.  And that problem
          centers not on the relocatable software itself, but on other programs
          that reference the relocatable software.
        </P
><P
>          For example, there are times when a package needs to execute other
          programs.  This might include backup software that needs to send mail,
          or a communications program that needs to compress files.  If these
          underlying programs were relocatable, and not installed where other
          packages expect them, then they would be of little use.
        </P
><P
>          Granted, this isn't a common problem, but it can happen.  And for the
          package builder interested in building relocatable packages, it's an
          issue that needs to be explored.  Unfortunately, this type of problem
          can be the hardest to find.
        </P
><P
>          If, however, a software product has been found to be relocatable, the
          mechanics of actually building a relocatable package are pretty
          straightforward.  Let's give it a try.
