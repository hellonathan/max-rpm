      Since our goal was to introduce package building, we kept things as simple
      as possible.  However, things aren't always that simple in the real world.
    </P
><P
>      In this chapter, we'll package a more complex application that will call
      on most of RPM's capabilities.  We'll start with a general overview of the
      application and end with a completed package, just as you would if you
      were tasked with packaging an application that you'd not seen before.

>An Overview of Amanda</A
></H1
><P
>        Amanda is a network backup utility.  The name amanda stands for
        "Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver".  If the word
        "Maryland" seems somewhat incongruous, it helps to realize that the
        program was developed at the University of Maryland by James Da Silva,
        and has subsequently been enhanced by many people around the world.
      </P
><P
>        The sources are available at <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ftp.cs.umd.edu</TT
>, in
        directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/pub/amanda</TT
>.  At the time of writing, the
        latest version of amanda is version 2.3.0.  Therefore, it should come as
        no surprise that the amanda source <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
> file is called
        amanda-2.3.0.tar.gz.
      </P
><P
>        As with most network-centric applications, amanda has a server
        component, and a client component.  An amanda server controls how the
        various client systems are backed up to the server's tape drive.  Each
        amanda client uses the operating system's native <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dump</B
>
        utility to perform the actual backup, which is then compressed and sent
        to the server.  A server can back itself up simply by having the client
        software installed and configured, just like any other client system.
      </P
><P
>        The software builds with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
>, and most customization
        is done in two <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.h</TT
> files in the
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config</TT
> subdirectory.  A fair amount of
        documentation is available in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>doc</TT
> subdirectory.
        All in all, amanda is a typical non-trivial application.
      </P
><P
>        Amanda can be built on several Unix-based operating systems.  In this
        chapter, we'll build and package amanda for Red Hat Linux Linux version 4.0.
