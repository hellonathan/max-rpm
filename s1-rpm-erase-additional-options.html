>          What happened?  The problem is that one or more of the packages
          installed on your system require the package you're trying to erase.
          Without it, they won't work properly.  In our example, the
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>blather</TT
> package won't work properly unless the
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bother</TT
> package (and more specifically,
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bother</TT
> version 3.1 or later) is installed.  Since
          we're trying to erase <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bother</TT
>, RPM aborted the
          erasure.
        </P
><P
>          Now, 99 times out of 100, this is exactly the right thing for RPM to
          do.  After all, if the package is needed by other packages, why try to
          erase it?  As with everything else in life, there are exceptions to
          the rule.  And that is why there is a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--nodeps</B

          option.
        </P
><P
>          Adding the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--nodeps</B
> options to an erase command
          directs RPM to ignore any dependency-related problems, and to erase
          the package.  Going back to our example above, let's add the
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--nodeps</B
> option to the command line and see what
          happens:

          <TT

          matter.  In general, it's not a good idea to use
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--nodeps</B
> to get around dependency problems.  The
          package builders included the dependency requirements for a reason,
