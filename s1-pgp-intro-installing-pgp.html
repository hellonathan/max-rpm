      on your system.  If it's installed already, you should be able to flip
      to the chapters on verifying package signatures and signing packages and
      be in business in a matter of minutes.  Otherwise, read on for a
      thumbnail sketch of what's required to install PGP.

        PGP.  Unfortunately, this is not quite as simple as it might sound.
        The reason is that PGP is very controversial stuff.
      </P
><P
>        Why the controversy?  It centers on PGP's primary mission &#8212; to
        provide a means of communicating with others in complete privacy.  As
        we've discussed, PGP uses encryption to provide this privacy.  Good
        encryption.  <I

        good, it appears some of the world's governments consider PGP a threat

>                Part of the software that comprises PGP is protected by
                several United States patents.  Versions of PGP approved for
                use in the U.S. contain a licensed version of this software,
                known as RSAREF.  RSAREF includes a patent license that allows
                the use of the software in noncommercial settings only.
                Commercial use of the technology contained in RSAREF requires
                a separate license.  This is one reason why there are
                restrictions on the commercial use of PGP in the United States
                and Canada.

>                While people outside the U.S. and Canada can use RSAREF-based
                PGP, they will probably choose the so-called "international"
                version.  This version replaces RSAREF with software known as
                MPILIB. MPILIB is, in general, faster than RSAREF, but it
                cannot legally be used in the United States or Canada.

          incorporating RSAREF.  People in other countries can use any version

          the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Due to the restrictions
          on the export of encryption technology, the process is somewhat
          convoluted.  The easiest way to obtain PGP from the official MIT
          archive is to use the World Wide Web.  Point your web browser at:

          involves first using anonymous ftp to obtain several files of
          instructions and license agreements.  You will then be directed to
          use telnet to obtain the name of a temporary ftp directory
          containing the PGP software.  Finally, you can use anonymous ftp to
          retrieve the software.  To start this process, ftp to:

          or Web site advertising freely available software.  Be aware,
          however, that "Floyd's Storm Door and BBS Company" may not be as
          trustworthy a place as MIT to obtain encryption software.  It's
          really a question of how paranoid you are.

>          For people living in other countries, it is much easier to find PGP
          (depending on the legality of encryption software, of course).  Try
          any of the places you'd normally look for free software.  Keep in
          mind, however, that you shouldn't download PGP from any sites in the
          U.S.  Doing so is considered an "export" of munitions, and can get
          the people responsible for the site in deep trouble.  Wherever you
          eventually get PGP from, since the patents that complicate matters
          for the U.S. do not apply abroad, you'll probably end up with the
          "international" versions of PGP.
