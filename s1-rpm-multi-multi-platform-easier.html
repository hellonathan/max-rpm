>        As we mentioned above, RPM supports multi-platform package building
        through a set of tags, <TT

>rpmrc</TT
> file entries, and
        conditionals.  None of these tools are difficult to use.  In fact, the
        hardest part of multi-platform package building is figuring out how the
        software needs to be changed to support different platforms.

><P
>          The first thing necessary for easy multi-platform package building is
          to identify which platform the package is to be built for.  Except in
          the fairly esoteric case of cross-compilation, the build platform is
          the platform on which the package is built.  RPM does this for you
          automatically, although it can be overridden at build-time.

><P
>          The other important platform in package building is the platform on
          which the package is to be installed.  Here again, RPM does this for
          you, though it's possible to override this when the package is
          installed.
        </P
><P
>          But there is more to multi-platform package building than simply being
          able to determine the platform during package building and
          installation.  The next component in multi-platform package building
          is a set of platform-dependent tags.

>Platform-Dependent Tags</A
></H2
><P
>          RPM uses a number of tags that control which platforms can build a
          package.  These tags make it easier for the package builder to build
          multiple packages automatically, since the tags will keep RPM from
          attempting to build packages that are incompatible with the build
          platform.

NAME="S2-RPM-MULTI-PLATFORM-CONDITIONALS"
>Platform-Dependent Conditionals</A
></H2
><P
>          While the platform-dependent tags provide a crude level of
          multi-platform control (i.e., the package will be built or not,
          depending on the tags and the build platform), RPM's
          platform-dependent conditionals provide a much finer level of control.
          By using these conditionals, it's possible to excise those parts of
          the spec file that are specific to another platform and replace them
          with one or more lines that are compatible with the build platform.
        </P

          features, let's take a more in-depth look at each one.
