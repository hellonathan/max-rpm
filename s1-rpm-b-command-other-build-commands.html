>        There are two other commands that also perform build-related functions.
        However, they do not use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpmbuild</B
> command syntax
        that we've been studying so far.  Instead of specifying the name of the
        spec file, as with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpmbuild</B
>, it's necessary to specify
        the name of the source package file.
      </P
><P
>        Why the difference in syntax?  The reason has to do with the differing
        functions of these commands.  Unlike <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpmbuild</B
>, where
        the name of the game is to get software packaged into binary and source
        package files, these commands use an already-existing source package
        file as input.  Let's take a look at them:

          is not entirely the case.  Using <B

>          Package builders, particularly those that create packages for multiple
          architectures, often need to build their packages starting from the
          original sources.  The <B

>--rebuild</B
> option does this,
          starting from a source package file.  Here is the list of steps it
          performs:

          difference between the two commands is the fact that
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

          only remnants of a <B

          to create new binary packages using one command, with no additional
          cleanups required.  There are several times when
