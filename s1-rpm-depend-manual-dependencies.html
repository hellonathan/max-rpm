          a package requires.  Although we've used the word "capabilities", in
          fact, manual dependency requirements are always represented in terms
          of packages.  For example, if package <TT

          requires that package <TT

          necessary to add the following line to <TT

          would actually be redundant, because the RPM database already contains
          the name of every package installed.  There's no need to duplicate
          that information.

            name specified with the <B

            packages are handy when a package requires a certain capability, and
            that capability can be provided by any one of several packages.
            Here's an example:
          </P
><P
>            In order to work properly, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> needs a local
            delivery agent to handle mail delivery.  There are a number of
            different local delivery agents available &#8212;
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> will work just fine with any of them.
          </P
><P
>            In this case, it doesn't make sense to force the use of a particular
            local delivery agent; as long as one's installed,
            <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail</TT
>'s requirements will have been
            satisfied.  So <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail</TT
>'s package builder adds
            the following line to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail</TT

            virtual package.  The creators of the various local delivery agents
            indicate that their packages satisfy the requirements of the
            <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

            line to <I

            a package installed that provides the <TT
