>RPM Design Goals</A
></H1
><P
>        The design goals of RPM could best be summed up with the phrase
        "something for everyone".  While the main reason for the existence of
        RPM was to make it easier for Red Hat to build the several hundred
        packages that comprised their Linux distribution, it was not the only
        reason RPM was created.  Let's take a look at the various requirements
        the Red Hat team used in their design of RPM:

>Make it easy to get packages on and off the system</A
></H2
><P
>          As we've seen earlier in this chapter, the act of installing a package
          can involve many complex steps.  Entrusting these steps to a person
          who may not have the necessary experience is a strategy for failure.
          So the goal for RPM was to make it as easy as possible for
          <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>anyone</I
> to install packages.  The same holds true
          for removing packages.  It is a complex and error-prone operation, and
          one that RPM should handle for the user.
        </P
><P
>          The other side of this issue is that RPM should give the package
          builder almost total control in terms of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>how</I
> the
          package is installed.  The reason for this is simple: if the package
          builders do their homework, their package should install and uninstall
          properly.

>          Because software problems are a fact of life, the ability to verify
          the proper installation of a package is vital.  If done properly, it
          should be possible to catch a variety of problems, including things
          such as missing or modified files.

          reality it should be a small portion of the package builder's job.
          Why?  They've got better things to do!  If they are the people that
          are actually creating the software to be packaged,
          <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>that's</I
> where they should be spending the majority
          of their time.
        </P
><P
>          Even if the package builder isn't actually writing software, they
          still have better things to do than worry about building packages.
          For instance, they may be responsible for building many packages.  The
          less time spent on building an individual package translates to more
          packages that can be built.

>Make it start with the original source code</A
></H2
><P
>          Delving a bit more into the package builder's world, it was deemed
          important that RPM start with the original, unmodified source code.
          Why is this so important?
        </P
><P
>          Using the original sources makes it possible to separate the changes
          required to build the package from any changes implemented to fix
          bugs, add new features, or anything else.  This is a good thing for
          package builders, since many of them are <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> the
          original authors of the programs they package.
        </P
><P
>          This separation makes it easy, months down the road, to know exactly
          what changes were made in order to get the package to build.  This is
          important when a new version of the packaged software becomes
          available.  Many times it's only necessary to apply the original
          "package building" changes to the newer software.  At worst, the
          changes provide a starting point to determine what sorts of things
          might need to be changed in the new version.

NAME="S2-INTRO-TO-RPM-DIFFERENT-ARCHITECTURES"
>Make it work on different computer architectures</A
></H2
><P
>          One of the tougher things for a package builder to do is to take a
          program, make it run on more than one type of computer, and distribute
          packages for each.  Because RPM makes it easy to take a program's
          original source code, add the changes necessary to get it to build,
          and produce a package for each architecture in one step, it can be
          pretty handy.
