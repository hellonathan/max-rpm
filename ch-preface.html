>Linux and RPM &#8212; A Brief History</A
></H1
><P
>        Welcome!  This is a book about the Red Hat Package Manager, or RPM Package
        Manager, known to its friends as simply RPM.  The history of RPM is
        inextricably linked to the history of GNU/Linux, so a bit of GNU/Linux
        history may be in order.  GNU/Linux is a full-featured implementation of
        a UNIX-like operating system, and has taken the computing world by
        storm.
      </P
><P
>        And for a good reason &#8212; When choosing GNU/Linux, an Intel-based
        personal computer that had previously been prisoner of the dreaded
        Windows hourglass is transformed into a fully multitasking, network
        capable, personal <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>workstation</I
>.  All for the cost of
        the time required to download, install, and configure the software.
      </P
><P
>        Of course, if you're not the type to tinker with downloaded software,
        many companies have created CDROMs containing GNU/Linux and associated
        software.  The amount of tinkering required with these
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>distributions</I
> has varied widely.  The phrase "You
        get what you pay for" is never more true than in the area of GNU/Linux
        distributions.
      </P
><P
>        One distribution bears the curious name "Red Hat Linux".  Produced by a
        company of the same name, this GNU/Linux distribution was different.
        One of the key decisions a new Linux user needs to make is which of the
        many different parts of the distribution to install on their system.
        Most distributions use some sort of menu, making it easy to pick and
        choose.  Red Hat Linux is no different.
      </P
><P
>        But what <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>is</I
> different about Red Hat Linux is that the
        creators of the distribution wanted their customers to have the the
        ability to make the same choices long <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>after</I
> the
        installation process was over.  Some commercial UNIX systems have this
        capability (called "package management"), and a few GNU/Linux
        distributors were trying to come up with something similar, but none had
        at the time the extensive scope present in RPM.
      </P
><P
>        Over time, Red Hat Linux has become the most popular distribution available
        today.  For it to edge out the previous leader (Slackware) in just two
        years is amazing.  There has to be a reason for this kind of success,
        and a good part of the reason is RPM.  But until the first edition of
        this book, there had been precious little in terms of RPM documentation.
        You could say that RPM's ease of use has made detailed instructions
        practically unnecessary, and you'd be right.
      </P
><P
>        However, there are always people that want to know more about their
        computers, and given the popularity of Red Hat Linux, this alone would have made
        a book on RPM worthwhile.  But there's more to the story than that.
      </P
><P
>        There is a truism in the world of Free Software, that goes something
        like this: If there's a better solution freely available, use it!  RPM
        is no exception to the rule.  Put under the terms of the GNU General
        Public License (Meaning: RPM cannot be made proprietary by
        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>anyone</I
>, not even Bill Gates), RPM started to
        attract the attention of others in the Linux, Unix, and free software
        communities.
      </P
><P
>        At present, RPM is used by several commercial software companies
        producing Linux applications.  They find that RPM makes it easier to get
        their products into the hands of their customers.  They also find that
        it can even make the process of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>building</I
> their
        software easier.  (Those of you that develop software for fun and
        profit, stick around &#8212; the second half of this book will show you
        everything you need to know to get your software "RPM-ized")
      </P
><P
>        People have also ported RPM to several commercial UNIX systems,
        including DEC's Digital Unix, IBM's AIX, and Silicon Graphics' IRIX.
        Why?  The simple answer is that it makes it easier to install, upgrade,
        and de-install software.  If all these people are using RPM, shouldn't
        you?
