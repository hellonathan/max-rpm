        got to make sure PGP and RPM are up to the task.  As you might imagine,
        there are two parts to this process: one for PGP, and one for RPM.
        Let's get PGP ready first.

>          There is really very little to be done to PGP, assuming it's been
          installed properly.  The only thing required is to generate a key
          pair.  As mentioned in our mini-primer on PGP, the key pair consists
          of a secret key and a public key.  In terms of signing packages, you
          will use your secret key to do the actual signing.  Anyone interested
          in checking your signature will need your public key.
        </P
><P
>          Creating a key pair is quite simple.  All that's required is to issue
          a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pgp -kg</B
> command, enter some information, and
          create some random bits.  Here's an example key generating session:

>          Let's review each of the times PGP required information.  The first
          thing PGP needed to know was the key size we wanted.  Depending on
          your level of paranoia, simply choose an appropriate key size.  In our
          example, we chose the "They're out to get me" key size of 1024 bits.
        </P
><P
>          Next, we needed to choose a user ID for the key.  The user ID should
          be descriptive and should also include sufficient information for
          someone to contact you.  We entered <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>Example Key for RPM
          Book</KBD
>, which goes against our suggestion, but is sufficient
          for the purposes of our example.
        </P
><P
>          After entering a user ID, we needed to add a pass phrase.  The pass
          phrase is used to protect your secret key, so it should be something
          difficult for someone else to guess.  It should also be memorable for
          you, because if you forget your pass phrase, you won't be able to use
          your secret key!  I entered a couple of words and numbers, put
          together in such a way that no one could ever guess I typed
          <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>rpm2kool4words</KBD
>
        </P
><P
>          Oops&#8230;
        </P
><P
>          The pass phrase is entered twice, to ensure that no typing mistakes
          were made.  PGP also performs some cursory checks on the pass phrase,
          ensuring that the phrase is at least somewhat secure.
        </P
><P
>          Finally comes the strangest part of the key-generation process,
          creating random bits.  This is done by measuring the time between
          keystrokes.  The secret here is to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> hold down
          a key so that it auto-repeats and to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> wait
          several seconds between keystrokes.  Simply start typing anything
          (even nonsense text) until PGP tells you you've typed enough.
        </P
><P
>          After generating enough random bits, PGP takes a minute or so to
          create the key pair.  Assuming everything completed successfully,
          you'll see an ending message similar to the one above.  You'll also
          find, in a subdirectory of your login directory called
          <TT

CLASS="USERINPUT"

><P
>            The <B

            the environment variable <CODE
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGPPATH</CODE

            In our example, we didn't move them from PGP's default location,
            which is in the subdirectory <TT

>, off the
            user's login directory.  Since we generated the key as

            <TT
