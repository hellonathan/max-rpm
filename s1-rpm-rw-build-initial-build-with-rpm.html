            confirms that the makefiles don't bother to clean these two
            directories.  That's a nice touch because a <B

            That's intentional, as we want to make sure those changes are

          We'll undoubtedly be changing that as we continue work on the spec

          line; the Uniform Resource Locator there points to the homepage for

Summary: Server-side Amanda package
Group: System/Backup
%description server
The Amanda Network Backup system contains software necessary to
automatically perform backups across a network.  Amanda consists of
two package -- a client, and a server (this package):

The server package enables a network-capable system to control one
or more Amanda client systems performing backups.  The server system
will direct all backups to a locally attached tape drive.  Therefore,
the server system requires a tape drive.

NOTE: In order for a system to perform backups of itself, install both
the client and server packages!</SAMP

>          No surprises here, really.  You'll note that the server subpackage has
          no <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>requires</B
> tag for the dump package.  The reason
          for that is due to a design decision we've made.  Since amanda is
          comprised of a client and a server component, in order for the server
          system to perform backups of itself, the client component must be
          installed.  Since we've already made the client subpackage require
          <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dump</B
>, we've already covered the bases.
        </P
><P
>          Since an amanda server cannot back itself up without the client
          software, why don't we have the server subpackage require the client
          subpackage?  Well, that could be done, but the fact of the matter is
          that there are cases where an amanda server won't need to back itself
          up.  So the server subpackage needs no package requirements.
