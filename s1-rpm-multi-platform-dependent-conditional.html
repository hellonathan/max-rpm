        building is often too coarse.  There may be packages, for example, that
        would build just fine on another platform, if only you could substitute
        a platform-specific patch file or change some paths in the
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%files</B
> list.
      </P
><P
>        The key to exerting this kind of platform-specific control in the spec
        file is to use RPM's conditionals.  The conditionals provide a
        general-purpose means of constructing a platform-specific version of the
        spec file during the actual build process.

></H2
><P
>          There are a few things that are common to each conditional, so let's
          discuss them first.  The first thing is that conditionals are
          block-structured.  The second is that conditionals can be nested.
          Finally, conditionals can span any part of the spec file.

NAME="S3-RPM-MULTI-CONDITIONALS-BLOCK-STRUCTURED"
>Conditionals Are Block Structured</A
></H3
><P
>            Every conditional is block-structured &#8212; in other words, the
            conditional begins at a certain point within the spec file and
            continues some number of lines until it is ended.  This forms a
            block that will be used or ignored, depending on the platform the
            conditional is checking for, as well as the build platform itself.
          </P
><P
>            Every conditional starts with a line beginning with the characters
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%if</B
> and is followed by one of four
            platform-related conditions.  Every conditional ends with a line
            containing the characters <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%endif</B
>.
          </P
><P
>            Ignoring the platform-related conditions for a moment, here's an
            example of a conditional block:

            <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>%ifos Linux
Summary: This is a package for the Linux operating system
%endif</SAMP
>
            </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
          </P
><P
>            It's a one-line block, but a block nonetheless.
          </P
><P
>            There's also another style of conditional block.  As before, it
            starts with a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%if</B
>, and ends with a
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%endif</B
>.  But there's something new in the middle:

            <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"

Summary: This is a package for some other operating system
%endif</SAMP
>

>
          </P

CLASS="SECT3"

CLASS="SECT3"
><A
NAME="S3-RPM-MULTI-NESTED-CONDITIONALS"
>Conditionals Can Be Nested</A
></H3
><P
>            Conditionals can be nested &#8212; That is, the block formed by one
            conditional can enclose another conditional.  Here's an example:

            <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>%ifarch i386

echo "This is an i386"

%ifos Linux
echo "This is a Linux system"
%else
echo "This is not a Linux system"
%endif

%else

echo "This is not an i386"

%endif</SAMP
>
            </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
          </P
><P
>            In this example, the first conditional block formed by the
              <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%ifarch i386</B
> line contains a complete
              <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%ifos &#8212; %else &#8212; %endif</B
> conditional.
              Therefore, if the build system was Intel-based, the
              <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%ifos</B
> conditional would be tested.  If the
              build system was <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> Intel-based, the
              <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>%ifos</B
> conditional would not be tested.

NAME="S3-RPM-MULTI-CONDITIONALS-CROSS"

></H3
><P
>            The next thing each conditional has in common is that there is no
            limit to the number of lines a conditional block can contain.  You
            could enclose the entire spec file within a conditional, if you
            like.  But it's much better to use conditionals to insert only the
            appropriate platform-specific contents.
          </P

>            Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's take a look at
            each of the conditionals and see how they work.
